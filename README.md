## Project Overview

This project examines the motion picture industry, which incorporates a wide range of genres. Every year, a number of studios attempt to gain a piece of the motion picture entertainment market by releasing these films. Microsoft can use this analysis to be able to know how to enter the motion picture industry

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder Data are movie datasets from:
* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

The data files provide the types of genres, domestic gross, foreign gross, movie titles, the runtime of the movies, average ratings, and the number of votes for each move.

## Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis and a lot of data visualization such as bar graphs and scatter plots to know the best genres and movie studios. 

### Results

### Conclusions

- The ten most popular genres of movies for both the market audience.
- The genres with the highest total revenue globally. This is the total revenue of both the domestic gross and foreign gross. This factors in both audiences and can be used for big box bluster movies
- The genres with the highest domestic gross may vary different to total revenue and foreign gross of the genre due to the preference of the domestic audience
- The genres with the highest foreign gross may vary different to the domestic revenue of the genre due to the preference of the foreign audience for the domestic audience:
- The top ten studios with the best total revenue. These are the best-performing studios when it comes to making movies that will bring high revenue to the market at large.
- Studios with the best revenue, domestic and foreign. These are the best-performing studios in their respective markets. The studio may vary with the different audiences, these been domestic and foreign

### Recommendations

- **For the domestic audience:** Microsoft should focus more on producing Sci-Fi since it brings the most revenue to the domestic audience followed by Adventure,Drama,Sport.
- **For foreign audiences:** Microsoft should focus more on producing Adventure, Drama, and Sports followed by Adventure and fantasy to yield more revenue for them in the long run.
- **For the market at large:** In terms of both markets, this will be useful in creating big movies that both audiences enjoy. They should focus more on Adventure, Drama, Sport followed by Sci-Fi movies.
- **Most popular movie genres for their online streaming services:** This will help Microsoft Studios break into the online streaming markets. They should focus more on providing movies based on drama followed by comedy, drama, and romance genres. This would help them get more subscribers.
- **Collaboration with other studios:** When collaborating with other studios for the market at large for things such as crossovers, the recommended studio is P/DW followed by BV. This will not only bring more revenue for them but also exposure and revenue for the other studios. In terms of the respective markets, domestic and foreign. Microsoft can collaborate with the respective studios to perform best.

## Summary
